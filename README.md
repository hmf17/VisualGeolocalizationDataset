# Deep Visual Geo-localization Benchmark
This repository is the revised version from the original Deep VGL benchmark [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03444) and [Code](https://github.com/gmberton/deep-visual-geo-localization-benchmark)

We add some customer modules to meet the requirement of our own datasets. The details and full datasets will be provided if our paper is accepted.
